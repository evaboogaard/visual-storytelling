          <h2>CHAPTER ONE: SUPERHERO GENRE</h2>
          <p>
            In chapter one titled, the ‘Superhero genre’ Coogan begins with the
            statement “Wonder Woman is a superheroine, not a female superhero.”
            [pg 1] proceeding to define the superhero as someone who’s
            “selflessly using power to improve the community and their outsider
            status to make things better.” [pg 2] then contrasts the ‘female’
            genres of romance, musicals, and melodramas to the more ‘masculine’
            genres of adventure, westerns and superhero orientated stories
            presenting to us the misogynistic stereotyped divide that exists
            within these genres and the origins of the superhero.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are presented with historical context into the superhero genre,
            describing American superheroes as “The sons of Daniel Boone” [pg 2]
            Daniel Boone was a figure from the 18th-19th century regarded as one
            of the first folk heroes of America, Coogan describes “The Boone
            figure” as “the most important hero in American storytelling” [pg
            2]. The predecessors to Boone’s narratives in American mythology had
            previously not had any human heroes, only God was in the position of
            rescuer, “by replacing God, Boone changed American Mythology, by
            replacing the classical monomyth structure with the American
            monomyth” [pg 3].
          </p>

          <h2>CHAPTER TWO: THE GENESIS OF WONDERWOMAN</h2>
          <p>
            “Wonder Woman is not a daughter of Daniel Boone.” [pg 3], but rather
            of William Moulton Marston, who’s origins of the character find
            itself based off of feminist utopian science fiction from the likes
            of ‘Herland’ and ‘Her in Ourland’ by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this chapter, Coogan properly introduces Wonder Woman as a
            character within the essay and her standout features against her
            male counterparts. One of her individualistic differences is that
            “her diegetic origin story does not follow the hero’s journey.” [pg
            4], arguably this makes sense as Coogan soon follows up with “The
            hero’s journey is a mythological way to teach boys to put their
            power in service of their community” [pg 4]. Furthermore, because of
            this difference in Marston’s writing of Wonder Woman, author Carolyn
            Cocca describes her as ‘antinormative’ [pg 5] finishing with Coogan
            stating he believes Wonder Woman “Changed the superhero narrative.”
            [pg 5].
          </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h2>CHAPTER THREE: THE SUPERHEROINE SUBGENRE</h2>
          <p>
            “The superheroine subgenre is not about power and responsibility, it
            is about love.” Culture critic Jennifer K. Stuller exclaims, [pg
            5-6]. Throughout this chapter, the differences between the superhero
            genre and the superheroine genre are outlined, the most notable
            distinction between the two is the different approaches toward
            helping their respective communities and the role love plays. Coogan
            notes how superheroes often are required to leave their community to
            return with a power or object that will benefit everyone once the
            hero has returned, meanwhile Wonder Woman’s gifts are from within
            the community rather than the outside world. She often acts as a
            mentor to those around her and those she introduces into the
            community, she teaches others about love and respect for other human
            beings as well as fulfilling their hierarchy of needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Wonder Woman’s vision is an expression of the ontological vocation
            of humanisation” [pg 7]
          </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h2>CHAPTER 4: MISUNDERSTANDING MARSTON’S VISION</h2>
          <p>
            The central theme of this chapter revolves around how misunderstood
            Wonder Woman is as a character in modern depictions past Marston’s
            run, and how these misrepresentations often reject the original
            feminist messages Marston had. Coogan notes that after Marston’s
            death, comic writer Robert Kanigher took his position as writer for
            the series noting he was not a feminist and his transformation of
            Wonder Woman was “part of the larger postwar domestication
            movement.” [pg 8]. Since Kanigher’s takeover, Wonder Woman has
            struggled with being subject to the male gaze, often seen being
            hypersexualised, unequal to her male companions and in some
            instances infantilised.
          </p>
          <p>
            If not just a product of misogyny, her role as a super heroine has
            also been misconstrued over time. Despite her values of love,
            mentorship and her role in helping characters up Maslow’s hierarchy
            of needs; some writers have turned her into a vigilante character.
            In his work, writer Gregg Rucka has taken Wonder Woman from her
            values and allowed her to kill, an act Superman and Batman refuse to
            do. Where these writers often fail in presenting Wonder Woman, comes
            from the lack of ability to understand her character as a
            superheroine and not a superhero.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If she is no longer the ambassador of peace and love, if she is the
            same as Superman or Batman, then she is no longer the anti-normative
            superhero Marston created.” [pg 10].
          </p>

        <article>
          <h2>CHAPTER 5: A SENSATIONAL VICTORY</h2>
          <p>
            To conclude the essay, a discussion of representation within Wonder
            Woman is brought into debate. It is promptly noted that overlapping
            with Brian Azzarello and Cliff Chiang’s run of Wonder Woman in which
            they move her character away from being a super heroine – editor
            Kirsty Quinn is placed in charge of a stand-alone comic book series
            running alongside Azzarello and Chiang’s, Sensation Comics. During
            Quinn’s run as editor on this series, she brought in mostly female
            writers who were able to put the super heroine subgenre back into a
            multitude of stories. Wonder Woman is placed back into her role as a
            mentor teaching her values to the community, bringing back the
            original elements of her character.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coogan once again restates that Wonder Woman’s significance isn’t
            because she is a female superhero, but because she is a
            superheroine. The visibility of her gender shouldn’t be the main
            asset of her character, and that good representation is dependent on
            how she is written and presented to the viewer. Representation in
            media matters but picking and choosing characters based on
            appearance to fill diversity quotas isn’t good enough, “If
            representational visibility equals power, then almost-naked young
            white women should be running Western culture.” [Quoted from Peggy
            Phelan, pg 12]
          </p>
          <p>
            The essay starts to wrap up by bringing to light the work of Gail
            Simone, a female writer who wrote for Wonder Woman from 2007 for 30
            issues of its run, who was able to demonstrate Marston’s vision by
            presenting Wonder Woman as a vehicle for change. Simone was able to
            make a statement with the character, following the previous comic’s
            arc “Amazon’s attack”, which presented the Amazon women as merciless
            man killers. She was able to move the story past this disastrous
            plot point, and years of damaging writing, leaving room for Wonder
            Woman to grow back into Marston’s vision. “Love, collaboration,
            companionship and mentorship – Simone reasserts these themes and
            recuperates Wonder Woman’s story away from the superhero genre and
            toward the superheroine subgenre.” [pg 13].
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is the legacy of Wonder Woman. She was not the first heroine,
            she was not the first female superhero, but she was the first
            superheroine.” [Pg 13]

                Daniel Boone (1734 - 1820) becomes the father of what we
                perceive as the modern American superhero, “God was the divine
                rescuer of the captive. But Boone rescued himself and then his
                daughter and another girl from captivity. In doing so Boone
                displaced God as the redeemer. By replacing God, Boone changed
                American myth.”

          Shazam fan. Should you need to find me after school, look in the local
          arcade. Otherwise, I can also be found streaming on Twitch or looking
          for ways to help Ukraine. I haven’t made a name for myself yet, but
          I’m getting there. To catch me streaming, check out my speedpaints or
          my artworks, type naynaychan00 on Twitch, Instagram, ArtStation and
          YouTube.
