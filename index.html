                Daniel Boone (1734 - 1820) becomes the father of what we
                perceive as the modern American superhero, “God was the divine
                rescuer of the captive. But Boone rescued himself and then his
                daughter and another girl from captivity. In doing so Boone
                displaced God as the redeemer. By replacing God, Boone changed
                American myth.”

                Wonder Woman is created by writer William Moulton Marston and
                artist Harry G. Peter, “Marston drew inspiration from feminist
                utopian science fiction such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s
                ‘Herland’ (1915) and ‘Her in Ourland’ (1915).
