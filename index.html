                Daniel Boone (1734 - 1820) becomes the father of what we
                perceive as the modern American superhero, “God was the divine
                rescuer of the captive. But Boone rescued himself and then his
                daughter and another girl from captivity. In doing so Boone
                displaced God as the redeemer. By replacing God, Boone changed
                American myth.”

                Wonder Woman is created by writer William Moulton Marston and
                artist Harry G. Peter, “Marston drew inspiration from feminist
                utopian science fiction such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s
                ‘Herland’ (1915) and ‘Her in Ourland’ (1915).

                Robert Kanigher took over the Wonder Woman comics from Wonder
                Woman #22, he was not a feminist. “He transformed Wonder Woman
                at the end of the 1940s as part of the larger postwar
                domestication movement. She is disempowered, taken away from
                adventuring, and shifted into romance comics.”

                Wonder Woman #36 (Williams and Lyle, 2015) “Diana is drawn as
                though she is constantly on the verge of bursting into tears,
                with breasts as big as her head, and a waist thinner than her
                thigh…she looks like a tiny, petulant teenager” (Kremer,2015) in
                (Coogan, 2018, pg 9) “This portrayal of Wonder Woman
                demonstrates that many writers and artists do not understand the
                Marston’s vision for the character nor the superheroine
                subgenre” (Coogan)
